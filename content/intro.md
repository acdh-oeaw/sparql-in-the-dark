# SPARQL in the Dark ✨🌘

**Patterns for Exploring Uncharted DH Knowledge Graphs**

## Introduction
*SPARQL in the Dark* is a collection of practical SPARQL patterns and strategies for exploring unknown Knowledge Graphs.

The patterns presented here treat SPARQL as a discovery tool for incrementally (and often *maieutically*) revealing Knowledge Graph structure, entities, relationships, and modelling conventions - i.e. the data shapes manifested in a given graph.

This repository provides reusable SPARQL query templates, methodological notes, as well as examples and query strategies drawn from Digital Humanities datasets, but the patterns generalize to any unfamiliar RDF graph
